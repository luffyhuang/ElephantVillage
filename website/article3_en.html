    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, riding elephants and watching elephant shows have been a popular standard item for tourists in Thailand's tourism industry. Then, do you know that how many steps it takes to tame a wild elephant?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffering

   Elephants are originally wild animals. To make them serve humans, elephant trainers usually use a traditional technique called "Pajaan". "Pajaan" means "to break or to separate": on the one hand, to separate the elephant from its family, and on the other hand to separate the elephant's spirit from its body.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are crammed into a small cage where they can only stand and are constantly beaten to death with hooks, denied food and water, subjected to deliberate human noise, and prevented from sleeping all day. During the training, the elephant trainer also uses a pointed stick to hit and stab to control and direct their behavior.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being tamed is only the beginning of the elephant's suffering, followed by a long "business life" - being used by various scenic spots to provide rides. Although elephants may look strong, in fact their backs are very fragile. An adult elephant can bear the weight of up to 150 kg for four hours, while in the ride, the weight of two adults with an iron frame is well over 150 kilograms. Domesticated elephants carrying such weight often have to work for more than ten hours a day, leaving unrecoverable dents in the back.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even without tourists, these tamed elephants are not better off.
   Thailand's tourism industry has been hit hard since the outbreak of the Covid-19 epidemic, which has put thousands of elephants "out of work". The ensuing food shortage has also forced them to face starvation. If not rescued in time, many of the elephants will likely find themselves in an even more dire situation: forced to return to the streets to beg or be sold to illegal loggers for hard labor, said Tirappa, president of the Thai Elephant Federation.
   
   Still suffering
   
   Unlike African elephants, Asian elephants living in Thailand have been able to avoid poaching because their tusks are too short, but their living environment is often in crisis because of human intrusion.
   In April 2018, a wild elephant in Thailand was killed by electric shock after accidentally touching a high-voltage power line near a cistern while eating pineapples in a pineapple orchard. As early as 2009, a wild elephant died in Chiang Mai, Thailand, after eating kale with pesticides.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that hundreds of wild elephants in Thailand die each year due to similar human causes.
   Conflicts between humans and elephants are frequent, as local villagers hunt wild elephants in retaliation for trampling their fields or stealing their crops. In countries such as India, where Asian elephants have substantial populations, it is common for the animals to cause economic losses and threaten the lives of villagers.
   There are many reasons for the human-elephant conflict, but it is generally believed that the main reasons are as follows: the growing population has crowded out the living space of Asian elephants; With less food available in the wild, Asian elephants are increasingly trying to feed on corn, rice, sugar cane and other crops grown by humans.
   A hundred years ago, there were more than 300,000 wild elephants in Thailand. Today, there are fewer than 1,500 left in the wild and 3,500 in captivity.
   Thailand is also the world's largest market for unregulated ivory products and a major destination for ivory smuggling from African elephants.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is Thailand, so far from Africa, a destination for African ivory?
   In fact, many elephants were captured and domesticated long before Thailand's wildlife protection laws were introduced. According to local law, tusks from domesticated elephants can be sold when they are lost naturally. This rule has given some ivory traders an advantage. It is not technically difficult to sell smuggled African ivory legally disguised as tusks from domesticated Asian elephants.
   As a result, in addition to native Asian elephants, the survival of African elephants is also affected by Thailand's ivory policy.
   
   Give elephants a pure land
   
   Elephants, who have been repeatedly harmed by human behavior, need a place free from sin and harm.
   In 2015, under pressure from the international community, the Thai government implemented a nationwide ivory protection plan, strictly controlling the ivory trade: the government within the territory of Thailand check and issued more than 3000 ivory a certificate. For any other carrying ivory and ivory products in Thailand, the one would be up for three years in jail or fined up to 6 million baht.
   In addition, Thai police have set up an ivory task force to crack down on the illegal ivory trade across the country, regularly checking and registering ivory shops and manufacturers to prevent smuggling. Since then, the number of ivory shops in Thailand has dropped from 215 to 151 in a year. By the end of 2018, just over 120 stores were still selling legal ivory, and the amount of ivory sold had dropped significantly.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, illegal elephant poaching, ivory smuggling and other cases have been exposed and spread, so that more and more people are aware of the great harm brought by human beings to elephants. As a result, elephant nature parks, elephant shelters, rescue stations and so on have received more and more attention. There is no training, no abuse, no conflict, no poaching in these places.
   An elephant nature park in Chiang Mai is dedicated to helping and saving elephants. As a young woman, founder Sanden was shocked by the plight of many captive elephants. From then, she decided to get involved in helping and saving elephants, something she has been doing for more than 20 years till now.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception, the Elephant Nature Park has been treating elephants equally and kindly, rejecting any commercialization, and educating people about wild elephant conservation who come to visit or volunteer.
   "People don't come here to have fun with the elephants," she said. "They come here to make the elephants happy and to make them feel loved."
