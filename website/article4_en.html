    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, the elephants in Thailand are more fun than the ones here because you can ride them." Said a tourist visiting Xishuangbanna in an interview.
 
        "We came to Wild Elephant Valley mainly because it is a scenic spot and we might see the elephants." said a mother with her child. In today's society, not many people know about wildlife and even fewer care about wildlife protection.
         
        The so-called wild animals refer to the animals that live in a purely natural environment for a long time and have not been domesticated by humans. The rapid increase of human activities in recent decades has led to a significant reduction in the living space of wild animals, and their survival has been severely challenged. The scientific community has been researching wildlife protection for many years, during which the term “wild protection awareness” has been derived.
         
        The awareness of wildlife protection consists of three levels: what wild animals are, why they should be protected, and how to protect them. To protect wild animals, people have built nature reserves. According to China Forestry Net, reserves are roughly divided into 10 types: scientific reserves, national parks, natural sites, nature reserves, and scenic reserves. The site of this investigation, Wild Elephant Valley, is located in the Mengyangzi Nature Reserve of Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve and the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve. It is the first national park with animal protection and environmental protection theme in China.
         
        If you come to Xishuangbanna in Yunnan, Wild Elephant Valley has become a must pass for almost all tourists. Strolling through the wooded national park, you will find yourself in a true tropical rainforest: palm trees and tall banyan trees stand on both sides of the winding trail; beautiful green peacocks and flower-headed parrots contend in beauty and fascination, showing the vitality of nature to tourists. Standing on the high plank road overlooking, from time to time you can catch a glimpse of several fallen and torn deadwood trunks lying messily on the slopes of the mountainside----these are the footprints left by Asian elephants.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild Elephant Valley is the only place in China where tourists can have close communication with Asian wild elephants, and it is known as "the bridge between humans and Asian wild elephants." There are currently about 300 Asian elephants in China, of which more than 150 live in the Wild Elephant Valley. As a "National Science Education Base", it is also an ideal destination for many research teams, families, and ordinary tourists. But how much knowledge of Asian elephant conservation do tourists gain during the trip? Is there a significant increase in tourist awareness of Asian elephant conservation?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Random field interviews in the Wild Elephant Valley of Xishuangbanna in late July 2020 showed little interest among tourists in Asian elephants and their weak awareness of Asian elephants protection. Why does this happen? The reasons and solutions may be as follows:
 
 
    1. Establish a correct understanding of Asian elephants and Wild Elephant Valleys in advance
     
    Most of the visitors interviewed in the park visit the Wild Elephant Valley only to see the Asian elephants and take photos with them to show that they have been here. Whereas, the nature of the nature reserve, which is aimed to protect the Asian elephants, has been neglected.
     
    Some of the photos posted by web celebrities on social media are very misleading: holding the elephant’s trunk, touching the elephant’s body, and feeding it intimately... Viewers often confuse the concepts of wild elephants and domesticated elephants by viewing these posts. Most web celebrities feed the domesticated elephants in the park rather than the wild elephants in the reserve. Domesticated elephants have a fixed display space, while the locations of wild Asian elephants are unpredictable. After viewing such a video, the public tends to subconsciously think that wild Asian elephants can be seen everywhere in the Wild Elephant Valley and once they come to the valley, they would be able to see the wild elephants and take photos with them as the web celebrities did.
     
    "It's a pity that I didn't see the elephant today." An interviewee confided in his distress. As a result, Wild Elephant Valley took on the stage as a large live-action zoo, with its nature and wildlife preserve hidden in the background. Due to the above reasons, tourists' perception of Wild Elephant Valley is very likely to have been biased before coming to Wild Elephant Valley. To avoid misunderstandings, visitors should refer to the information about Wild Elephant Valley given on different websites, compare and verify different messages in order to gain a comprehensive understanding before entering the park. They should know what can be seen, what cannot be seen, and what may not be seen in the garden, and avoid a strong psychological gap.
     
    An interviewee who stayed at a hotel in Xishuangbanna Scenic Area mentioned another way to reduce the misunderstanding of Wild Elephant Valley. Wild Elephant Valley can cooperate with nearby hotels, such as sponsoring nearby hotels to give out small gifts related to wild elephants to upcoming visitors or listing information on the endangered wild elephants on nearby signboards, so as to help the tourists establish a preliminary understanding of the Wild Elephant Valley before entering the Valley.
     
    2. Improve the knowledge dissemination method in the Wild Elephant Valley Park
     
    Staff in Wild Elephant Valley Park said that tourists do not learn much about the Asian elephants after their visit, let alone establish a sense of conservation. The improvement of knowledge dissemination can not only start from the perspective of the audience, but also from the park itself.
     
    Jiang, the tour guide of Wild Elephant Valley, pointed out that one thing that could be adjusted in the park is the Asian Elephant Museum, which transmits a lot of relevant knowledge. The location of the pavilion is not ideal. As it is located at the north gate while most tourists enter and exit from the south gate, few tourists actually visit the pavilion. To make matters worse, most of the panels are old and lack an interactive way of displaying them, so even if the visitors do enter the exhibition hall, they will only take a few glances, and then walk away. The survival status and related knowledge of wild elephants introduced in the pavilion would not leave them a deep impression.

    "So far, the treatment of the female elephant has been quite successful. She is still taking care of other baby elephants as an aunt." Facing the wild elephant rescue materials on display which still stuck in 2007, the narrator also explained that "the information on this board should be updated."
 
    In fact, QR codes for voice explanations have also been set up in the museum, but with similarly limited effectiveness. In the faded color picture panels and boring large paragraphs of text in the pavilion, visitors can hardly maintain their attention on the information. After entering, they only want to take a few photos and then leave. There is no time to scan the QR code and learn more in-depth information.
     
    Indeed, the display board in the Asian Elephant Museum needs to be updated to let visitors learn more about the progress and results of the rescue of wild elephants, to raise their awareness, and encourage them to participate in it. At the same time, a more innovative text layout combined with technological interaction elements can also be used in the display, such as adding some interactive touch screens or holding some quiz contests about the background knowledge of wild elephants to attract tourists' interest. If the reserve is willing to make some improvements, it may be able to greatly increase the amount of knowledge that tourists can learn about Asian elephants during their visit, and thus improve their awareness of wild conservation.
     
    3. Participation in Asian elephants conservation is not out of reach
     
    After understanding and learning about wildlife protection, it comes to the implementation stage, which is the most confusing stage for the public. Having learned that wild animals need to be protected, many people do not know how to do their part to help them.
     
    "So this is the elephant orphanage, but what should we do to help them?"
     
    After a visit to the Asian Elephant Museum, an elderly couple wondered how to get involved in wildlife conservation. When the tourists returned with the wonderful memories in the Wild Elephant Valley and a desire to protect Asian elephants, they found no direct and clear way to get involved. Many tourists to the Wild Elephant Valley said even if they understand the importance of protecting Asian elephants, they still felt powerless and failed to speak up for wildlife.
     
    To conclude, the public has a sense of distance from the practice of wild protection. People may find themselves unable to help, or unable to spare time in their daily work and study. Over time, they gradually lose interest in wild conservation.
     
    To continuously enhance tourists' awareness of wildlife protection and to provide opportunities for them to develop their enthusiasm for wildlife protection, good advocacy, and publicity work are indispensable. Many tourists expressed their hope that relevant institutions (such as Wild Elephant Valley itself) could provide official donation channels to involve tourists in the project of protecting wild Asian elephants or distribute some brochures about volunteer activities in the park.
     
    Some tourists also said that handing out some small souvenirs related to Asian elephants at surrounding hotels would keep their attention on the issue long after the trip and increase their possibility of participating in the protection cause. Besides, they also hoped that the donation can be open and transparent so that they can be informed in time of the whereabouts of the donations and the results achieved with these funds. This would allow them to understand that as long as they make a contribution, no matter how small or large, they can truly help the Asian elephants, which will also attract more people to participate in this cause.
     
    As the China program officer of the Zoological Society of London and the initiator of the "Pictogram Project", Ms. Chen Shu has been engaged in wildlife conservation education for 10 years. "I found that one person's power is really meager." In fact, she is also the only member of the domestic branch of the Zoological Society of London. The more people who are willing to protect wild animals, the better the intensity and effect of protection.
     
     
    4. The promotion of wild awareness should be gradual
     
    The cultivation of public awareness of wild protection is not a problem that can be solved overnight. After all, the country is now focusing on economic development, and the protection of wildlife and the popularization of relevant knowledge needs to be improved. Besides, the idea of wildlife protection also to be slowly accepted by the public.
     
    "Nowadays, young people spend too much time indoors and have no chance to interact with nature, which reduces their awareness of animal protection and shows more indifference to related issues." Said Ms. Chen in an interview
     
    Ms. Chen believes that it is very necessary to educate primary and middle school students about the awareness of wildlife protection so that children can be cultivated to protect wildlife from an early age. "Let them go outdoors, interact with nature, and arouse their affinity to animals that have been engraved in genes since the Stone Age, which is the desire to protect nature and animals. After they grow up, they may engage in related occupations and contribute to wildlife conservation."
     
    Liu, who is in charge of curriculum design and teacher training at Wild Elephant Valley, believes that raising public awareness of wildlife protection is a complicated social issue. The worldview of the general public, especially adults, has been finalized and is difficult to change. When it is not feasible to directly change their minds, legal means and coercive measures are needed to guide them to make the right choice.
     
    For example, for those who believe in the infinite value of ivory products, it is necessary to restrict their consumption of wild animal products by enacting legal treaties such as the ban on trade of ivory. For people who think that elephants are pets and want to get up close to them, whether wild or domesticated, national parks such as Wild Elephant Valley could have more warning signs or tighter supervision of visitor behavior through guides. This can not only emphasize the danger of elephants, especially wild elephants, to tourists but also deter tourists in a timely manner from breaking the regulations and making dangerous actions. After all, in Xishuangbanna alone, there have been more than ten instances of tourists being trampled to death by wild elephants due to lack of safety awareness or non-compliance with the rules of scenic spots.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the famous British zoologist Jane Goodall said, " Only if we understand, will we care. Only if we care, will we help. Only if we help shall all be saved "
 
    If we want to better protect wild animals, we should start with understanding them. Wild animals like Asian elephants are neither cruel, ferocious, powerful beasts, nor elegant, easy-going, and submissive pets. Only by understanding wild animals correctly can people better protect them. If you visit Wild Elephant Valley in the future, you might as well ask yourself: I saw an elephant, but do I really understand it?
