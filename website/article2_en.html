    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elephant is the ancestor of the Dai people, and we worship it very much. It was not until five years ago that they came here. It was about four in the morning, and I went with another guy to pick up some stuff. It was quite dark, and an elephant was right on the road, walking up to us with little sound. It shook our car with its nose a few times and then went away. I was so scared when I saw it that my legs were shaking. It felt like my legs were not even my own." Said a villager from a farm in Menga town.
        Since ancient times, the elephant is a very intelligent animal and a symbol of good luck in the culture of the Dai people in Xishuangbanna. The villagers believed they should kneel down when they saw an elephant.
        Dr. Li Lili, who studies Asian elephants, said, " Every elephant is exactly the same as a human once you pay attention. They are very different, as some elephants are bold while others are timid." When an elephant is in trouble, it would go to the human village and ask people for help.
        In Xishuangbanna today, however, the elephant has become a symbol of danger.
        "I was too scared to look at them. They chewed all of it (sugar cane) in one morning." A villager from Menga town dawn farm recounted his experience in March 2020, "Too many elephants were on our windows, and our house were ruined by them." When it came to their close encounters with elephants, the villagers' immediate feeling was fear and wish for them to never return.
        As China's first-class national protected wild animals, there are only 200 to 250 Asian elephants in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, and only 37,000 to 51,000 in the world at present. The average adult Asian elephant weighs 3 to 4 tons and can eat 240 kilograms of food a day, 6 to 8 percent of its body weight. With 260 different types of food to eat, the elephants often go to farms where "tasty" crops grown by villagers provide a steady stream of food. In addition, the continuous exploitation of forests has led to an increasing number of elephants who have lost their homes taking to roads, villages, and farmland, causing serious economic losses and casualties, thus forming an "elephant disaster". This, in turn, has fueled a growing hatred of Asian elephants among the people who live there.
         
        Village Xiangyanqing in Mengyangzi Reserve and dawn farm near Mangaozi Reserve are the worst-hit areas of all.
        Village Xiangyanqing is next to Wild Elephant Valley, and the local villagers are mainly engaged in agriculture. Although recently they gradually shifted to catering, homestay, and other tourism industries, their main economic source is still agricultural production. In order to prevent the infestation of Asian elephants, an anti-elephant fence and an early warning system that combines infrared cameras, patrol officers, and drones were built in Village Xiangyanqing. The system provides villagers with early warning of "elephant disasters" through broadcasting, mobile phone applications, and WeChat groups.
        Unlike Village Xiangyanqing, Menga town is far from the Reserve, and Asian elephants are a relatively new problem there. Residents there are relatively scattered, making it impossible to build an elephant fence. Thus, the early warning system uses drone patrols to track the elephants and then alerts villagers via radio, WeChat groups, and mobile apps.
        As forests decrease at a rapid speed, Asian elephants are losing their homes, being forced to invade human habitats, and become destroyers, endangering human life and property. At present, there is no effective solution to protect both Asian elephants and humans.
        The human-elephant conflict has always existed and will always exist.
        In order to reduce the property and spiritual losses caused by human-elephant conflicts, Yunnan Province began to allocate special funds annually to compensate for wildlife accidents in 1992. In 1998, the People's Government of Yunnan Province promulgated the Measures for Compensation for Damage of Person and Property Caused by Key Protected Terrestrial Wild Animals in Yunnan Province. In 2009, compensation for wildlife incidents switched from direct government compensation to commercial insurance compensation. In this regard, villagers from Menga town dawn farm said, "The insurance company would only pay 30% of the market price and we could not even get all of it." Therefore, although compensation can to some extent alleviate villagers' negative feelings towards the Asian elephant and the loss caused, it brings new problems.
        First, the staff at Wild Elephant Valley noted, "The insurance company responsible for compensation for wild elephant accidents is Pacific Insurance. An insurance company can't lose money, and it will if it pays the market price... The compensation has been going up over the last two years and is now probably a third of the market price."
        Second, the small amount of insurance compensation and the relatively complicated business procedures of insurance companies make local villagers reluctant to apply for compensation. Villagers in the Village Xiangyanqing, near Wild Elephant Valley, said that if Asian elephants break into a rubber forest and damage it, they will only be paid 20 yuan per tree, while the market price for each rubber tree is around 200 yuan. In addition to the low compensation, villagers also complain about the difficulty of applying. "Assuming that the Asian elephants damage the crops in the morning and we apply for the compensation immediately, if the man from the insurance company comes in that day, he would approve it. But if he comes the next day, as the damaged trees are not fresh, there would be no compensation." Villagers in Menga Town face the same problem. "Although the elephant does not eat the fish, it would go to the pond to take a bath and pulls the oxygen pump. Without that oxygen pump, the fish would die off one by one and melt in three or four days. When the insurance man comes, he would say there is no fish and refuse to pay."
        Third, even if the application requirements are met, the compensation is often delayed to the villagers. When asked how long it would take for the compensation to arrive, the villagers in Menga town said, "I applied almost three years ago and haven't received it yet." Local villagers do not think it is worth the hassle of a small, difficult and lengthy compensation package, so they do not hold out much hope for compensation.
        Fourthly, the unfair compensation mechanism also leads to the comparative psychology of some villagers. "We feel a bit unbalanced," a farmer told us. "We filed for compensation together with others. They lost all their cane fields and got paid, but we did not.”
        Since the compensation mechanism is difficult to perfect, people begin to work on more effective methods of elephant prevention.
         
        (1) Elephant Prevention Project -- Construction Project of Elephant Prevention Fence. It selected two villages, the Village Xiangyanqing and the SanLiu team, as a pilot for installation, hoping to prevent Asian elephants from entering villages or farmers' homes to forage for food and guarantee the villagers' lives and property.
        However, the total investment of the anti-elephant project is 1738664.05 yuan which is quite high and does not apply to a vast and sparsely populated farmland area. Therefore, it is very difficult to popularize and implement the elephant prevention project.

(2) Construction of Asian elephant feeding base. Asian elephant feeding base refers to the artificial planting of edible plants for wild Asian elephants in the areas where Asian elephants may appear, so as to effectively alleviate the conflict between residents and wild Asian elephants and improve the enthusiasm of local people to protect Asian elephants.
However, the elephants do not necessarily happen to be able to enter the feeding base since the feeding base area is relatively small. If the Asian elephants do much damage to the plants during feeding, there is still a need for long-term government investment in funding and manpower for the project.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, for villagers in many areas, there is currently no particularly effective way to keep their property safe. But for them, the safety of their own lives is a priority over their possessions – “Just run when you see an alert message in the WeChat group."
    The early warning system can let local people know whether the Asian elephants are close to the human living area, raising the vigilance of the villagers and allowing them to evacuate or take shelter. Thus, the possibility of human encountering and hurt by elephants can be reduced, and the purpose of relieving the human-elephant conflict can be finally achieved.
    In an interview with the staff of Guanping Protection Station, we learned that infrared cameras, rangers, and unmanned aerial vehicles(UAV) are now used for early warning. The rangers communicate by phone, using China Mobile's mobile network and the "Asian Elephant Monitoring and Alert" mobile app. Local villagers mostly receive notification of the elephants' approach via WeChat group broadcasts, radio broadcasts, and government-issued mobile phone apps and evacuated.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to our interviews with the villagers, with the increasing use of mobile phones, WeChat group broadcasts have become the most common way for villagers to receive early warnings. When the villagers were alerted, people in the Reserve of the Elephant Protection Project would avoid going outside, and villagers who cut glue and pick tea outside the protected area would evacuate to the protected area of the elephant prevention project.
    Menga 'a's residents are relatively scattered, so there is no way to build an elephant fence. When received the warning , the villagers had to evacuate. But villagers generally report that the early warning system has at least reduced the number of human deaths from encounters with Asian elephants.
    Early warning systems, which are relatively cheap and easy to implement, have become popular in affected villages and towns. However, there are some problems with the existing warning system.
    First, the equipment of the early warning system needs to be improved. Although the infrared camera can automatically carry out monitoring work, there are some problems such as blind spots and inaccurate identification, and UAV may disturb wild elephants. Therefore, the protection effect can be promoted by improving the monitoring equipment technology, improving the viewing Angle range and identification accuracy of the infrared camera, and reducing the noise of the UAV. At the same time, the technical problem of making the app alarm loud enough at the right time to alert the public to elephant activity is also to be solved.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, existing warning systems are largely manual. Although the fixed-point surveillance system such as an infrared camera can carry out the monitoring work automatically, it has the problems of blind spots and inaccurate identification and relies on manual tracking and identification to a certain extent. This raises the possibility of a delayed warning. The frequency and carefulness of manual patrols and UAV greatly affect the effectiveness of the entire early-warning system and threaten the lives of rangers. For example, when the rangers in Menga town are off duty at night, they are unable to monitor and report the movements of Asian elephants, which makes it impossible to avoid encounters between humans and elephants during that time. Therefore, only with the improvement of relevant technologies in the future can human’s pressure be better alleviated and personal safety be better protected.
    To sum up, there are a variety of existing methods to alleviate human-elephant conflicts, and each method can be complementary to one another so that the Asian elephants and the residents at the epicenter of human-elephant conflicts can be protected to a certain extent. However, due to the influence of many factors, such as policy, technology, economy, and nature, there are still many problems with these methods. Therefore, only when we really step into the human-elephant conflict can we realize the complexity of the problem.
    Bao Mingwei, the "elephant doctor" who has worked in Wild Elephant Valley for 20 years, offered this advice——"As elephants become more numerous, there will be conflicts when people and elephants meet. Elephants are getting bolder and bolder, while men are getting timider and timider. Therefore, we must be in awe of elephants!"
