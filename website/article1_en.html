    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear elephants please leave, no destructions any-more!" said a little girl in Dashujiao Village.
 
      The Asian elephant is a National First-class Protected Animal in China. The number of Asian elephants living in China has increased from 170 in the 1980s to about 300 today. At present, they are distributed in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Pu'er City, and Lincang City in Yunnan Province.
       
      With the improvement of the ecological environment and  increased awareness in wildlife protection, the scope of activities of Asian elephants has expanded. However, as the human population grows, increasing numbers of nature reserves  and surrounding areas are inhabited by humans. The elephant habitats overlapped with the villagers' farmland to a large extent. This results in a shortage of food sources and a highly fragmented territories for wild elephants. Thus, the wild elephant broke into the human village seeking food and shelter. [Source: The standing committee of Pu’er City people's Congress]
       
      According to villagers, the wild elephants began to "visit" Dashujiao Village in 2017, and then never leave.
       
      "Elephants have been in our village for a long time. Our production and daily life are impacted by them, and we have no idea." said Ma, an elephant early warning staff in Dashujiao Village.
       
      Due to the arrival of wild elephants, the problem of human-elephant conflict in Dashujiao Village has intensified.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elephants are coming 
 
   "There used to be an ancient tree in our village, which is why our village is named Dashujiao Village[Translator's note: Dashujiao means “The foot of the big tree” in Chinese]. Although the tree was killed by lightning in the 1950s, the name of the village has been handed down." An old man in the village told the origin of the village name.
    
   Dashujiao Village is located on the southwestern border of China. It is an administrative village in Jiangcheng County, Pu'er City, Yunnan Province. There are 14 villagers groups in the village, with about 2062 people. The villagers are mainly Han, as well as ethnic minorities such as Hani and Dai. Most villagers make a living from planting and animal husbandry.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to media reports, Asian elephants first appeared in Zhengdong Town in Jiangcheng in 2011 [CCTV]. After that, the elephant followed the Manlao River all the way north, passing through Manke Old Village and Man Laojie Village, and came to Dashujiao Village in 2017. Elephants have been roaming around the three villages for years. According to many villagers, elephants lived in Dashujiao Village for as long as 8 months.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wild elephants first arrived in Dashujiao Village, the villagers were full of curiosity about them and often went to see them in groups in their spare time. The local Dai people believe in Buddhism, in which elephants are regarded as patron saints. Therefore, some villagers hope that the arrival of elephants could bring them good luck.
 
   "I never saw an elephant before, so it is fanciful to me. When we heard that there were elephants in the nearby villages, we drove our children to see the elephants. There were hundreds of people. Some people even traveled a long way from Pu'er City and Jiangcheng. Some people came from other nearby villages. It was spectacular." Zhang from Dashujiao Village described the scene when he first saw an elephant.
    
   When the elephants first arrived in Dashujiao Village, they were "well-behaved". They foraged in the woods in day time and went to the Manlao River at night. In the beginning, the villagers had no fear of elephants, as if the elephants were still far away from them. As the days went by, the elephant seemed to have "knowledge" about the surrounding situation, and they became bolder enough to walk towards the farmland.
    
   In Dashujiao Village, with its rolling hills and fertile soil, villagers grow fields full of corn, sugar cane, rice, and other crops that wild elephants are fond of.
    
   "We work very hard to plant crops in the fields. Those elephants have never left since they got the food." Many villagers complained. Elephants always leave a mess wherever they go. The crops that are about to ripen just become their food.
    
   According to the elephant monitors, there are now more than 40 elephants roaming around Dashujiao Village. The villagers are very distressed since their production and life have been greatly affected.
    
   Elephants go away
    
    "Wild elephants are protected animals, so there’s nothing we can do", Zhang said helplessly.
    
   In Dashujiao Village, the impact of elephants on the villagers is mainly in two aspects: firstly, elephants often destroy the crops in the farmland, causing economic losses to the villagers; secondly, villagers' safety is facing a huge threat.
    
    Elephants will eat up crops such as sugarcane and corn so that the farmland owner will have little harvest. Crops that elephants are not interested in, such as tea, may also be crushed and trampled, thus withered. Besides, elephants will even directly enter the villagers’ yards, damaging vehicles, doors, windows, sofas, etc.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In 2020, almost 2.9 million yuan was compensated,” said the damage assessor in charge of insurance compensation in Dashujiao Village. “Most families have their fields invaded and destroyed by elephants almost once a month, and some families face multiple encounters a month. Every family loses more than 10,000 yuan a year on crops."
 
   Besides the direct financial losses, the arrival of wild elephants also brings many indirect losses.
    
   "If an elephant goes in the direction of our farming field, we won’t be able to do any work that day." said Yang.
    
   If the elephant arrives during the harvest season, farmers won't be able to go to the fields, which may lead to the spoilage of the mature crops since they cannot be harvested, causing losses to the villagers. However, given that the farmland has not been damaged by wild elephants, this loss is deemed indirect by the insurance company, so the villagers are not compensated.
    
   "When the elephant destroyed the house, the insurance company only compensates the cost of materials. They do not compensate for the labor, transportation, and other costs as these are indirect losses" A villager complained.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with property losses, the villagers are more worried about being hurt by wild elephants.
 
   The wild elephants wandering around in the area of Dashujiao Village pose a huge threat to the villagers’ safety.
    
   "If the elephants only eat our crops, we can accept it because of the insurance compensation. But we are afraid that elephants will attack people. This is related to everyone's safety and becomes the most worrying issue for villagers." Elephant monitor Ma worried. He went on to recount a personal encounter with an elephant:
    
   "Once I was riding my motorcycle looking for an elephant. As soon as I rounded the corner, an elephant was standing less than 10 meters away from me. I hurriedly dropped the motorcycle and jumped down the slope. It was quite dangerous. The elephant chased over right away. Then the motorcycle attracted it. It fiddled with the motorcycle curiously, and I escaped."
    
   This early warning staff, who has been dealing with elephants for a long time, managed to escape with his experience. If ordinary villagers encounter this situation, the consequences may be disastrous.
    
   During the day, people can check where the elephants are on the early warning platform and try to avoid them. It is at night that the villagers worry the most because elephants forage for about 16 hours a day, which means that they often hang around at night foraging and playing.
    
   "One night I heard something outside and knew it must be the elephant. I was so frightened that I hurriedly hid under the bed." Recalled one villager, pointing to the front door which was bumped by the elephant. "My father almost had a heart attack," she said, pointing to her trembling father.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In our village, there have been no deaths caused by elephants. There have been a few cases of elephants chasing people. Some elderly people were terrified." said Yang.
 
   Nowadays, many villagers have changed their views on elephants. "Elephants, go away!" They prayed.
    
    
   Possibility of human-elephant coexistence
   To alleviate the human-elephant conflict, the local government, villagers, and all walks of life have made many efforts.
    
   The government mainly adopted insurance compensation and elephant patrols to promote the harmonious coexistence of humans and elephants.
    
   In 2010, Yunnan Province introduced a government-funded “Public Liability Insurance for Wildlife Accidents”, paid by insurance companies, to compensate families for economic losses and deaths caused by wild animals.
    
     " I don’t need to take care of fields and harvest my crops. It's good to get compensation directly," said Zhang. 
    
   "In 2020, the insurance compensation has been increased. The price of corn on the market is 2.4 to 2.5 yuan per kilogram, and the insurance compensation is 2.3 yuan. For villagers, after excluding picking and transportation expenses, their actual income is around 2 yuan. The insurance directly compensates 2.3 yuan per kilogram for the crops the elephants have eaten." The insurance damage assessment staff said. Besides, villagers are generally satisfied with the speed of receiving the compensation.
    
   On the other hand, there are two full-time elephant warning staffs in Dashujiao Village. They remind the villagers to take active avoidance and other preventive measures through the Asian elephant warning platform, WeChat groups, text messages, and phone calls.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We saw elephants moving on the opposite hill, and some people doing farm work. Because of the long-distance, we will send notifications in the WeChat group to ask if anyone knows whose land this is. Then we notify the owner by phone call. Everyone in the group knows each other, so we can inform the people who were working in the field." The warning staff said.
 
   Besides, they also set up a warning sign that says"Attention. There are wild elephants ahead" to remind the villagers not to pass along the road where the elephants are seen.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, villagers are used to checking the track of elephants in the WeChat group before going out to do farm work. "It is essential to make sure that the place we are going to is safe in advance." The villager pointed to the WeChat group and said.
 
   In Dashujiao Village, the villagers have tried their own ways to reduce their losses.
    
   For example, some villagers would use firecrackers, lights, big horns, etc. to drive away elephants. Some villagers put up self-made fences in the yard to keep elephants out of their homes.
    
   Some villagers said, "The elephant is afraid of being hit by a slingshot. This is what we will do now——hitting its butt and body with the slingshot, and then it would run to the side of the road."
    
   Some villagers also use firecrackers to drive the elephants away. "It’s called ‘mountain cannons’. We used to use it to catch fish. These crackers are big and thick, and they lay them in a circuitous shape."
    
   However, such a method will not only cause harm to the elephants but may also cause retaliation by the elephants. The early warning staff warned that "Elephants are very vengeful. There have been incidents of elephants injuring people in places where firecrackers were used frequently."
    
   Some villagers use bright lights to chase away elephants. As for the effect, they said, "If you shine a bright flashlight on it, it will get a little scared and won't rush over and attack you directly."
    
   However, due to the lack of street lights in Dashujiao Village, many places are completely dark at night, which creates potential dangers for humans.
    
   "We can hide from the elephants in the daytime, but there is nothing we can do about it at night. Now, we don't even dare to go out at night. Sometimes when our family gets sick, we dare not go to the hospital", said Zhang, in frustration.
    
   Villagers are desperate for solar lights to be installed in every home, so they can see if elephants are around their yards and get basic protection

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some organizations have also launched public welfare actions for this purpose.
 
   The author has visited Dashujiao Village twice for investigation, and then made efforts to alleviate human-elephant conflicts. In March 2020, a WeChat official account was established to introduce the current situation of Asian elephants. Since August, several "Asia Elephant Public Welfare Photography Exhibitions" were held to spread public welfare on Dashujiao Village and Asian Elephants. Besides, the author improved the “solar elephant warning light” which has two functions: on the one hand, it can meet the needs of long-term lighting; on the other hand, its flickering can let elephants know that there are people living here and keep them away. At the same time, the author raised funds for the production of the warning lights by selling charity production such as photos of Asian elephants.
    
   The “elephant warning light” is planned to be installed in March 2021 to test its efficiency in keeping out elephants.

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, many villagers have expressed their desire to develop tourism.
 
   "Now, everything we grow will be eaten or trampled by elephants. Even if we raise fish or ducks, they would also be killed by elephants. We hope to attract people here to see the elephants and develop tourism, which can also bring us some income."
    
   China House, a charity organization, is planning to establish a local charity project based in the village. On the one hand, it will lead young people to explore the possibility of relieving human-elephant conflicts. On the other hand, it will help villagers sell agricultural products and develop farmhouse tourism so that villagers can "benefit" from elephants. It will promote the harmonious coexistence of humans and elephants.
    
   In the future, more charity actions will be launched in Dashujiao Village to alleviate human-elephant conflicts.
    
   In fields in Dashujiao Village, a mother elephant plays with her baby in the mud. The earth turned into a golden arc as the sunset. The villagers nearby were also affected by the harmonious scene and smiled unconsciously.
