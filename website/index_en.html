                        <p> For the residents in Dashujiao Village, Yunnan, elephants are "dangerous".

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2017, a group of wild Asian elephants migrated to this quiet village and stayed here.
                            Compared with leaves and grass, the sugarcane and corn in farmers' land are more welcomed by
                            them. After dining, they like to "play" around residents' homes, seemingly unaware that they
                            are prone to causing severe damages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “In 2020, almost 2.9 million yuan was compensated,” said the damage assessor who is in
                            charge of insurance compensation in Dashujiao Village. “Most families have their fields
                            invaded and destroyed by elephants almost once a month, and some families even face multiple
                            encounters. Every family loses more than 10,000 yuan per year on crops."
