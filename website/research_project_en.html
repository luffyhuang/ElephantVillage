In order to ensure the safety of the students and to facilitate communication and cooperation between the different groups, the itineraries for the group project are generally the same. We will match enough tutors and teaching assistants to help each group carry out their own targeted research work.

            <p class="item-title">Can we really learn something in such a short time spent on field research?</p>
            <p class="item-intro">During the field research period, the study and work intensity are very heavy. Under the careful arrangement of the tutor, the students will have a very substantial schedule from morning till night. In addition, the field research trip is only a part of the project, the whole project cycle is about two months. One month before departure, the tutor will focus on teaching students research methods and lead students to carry out online research. One month after the completion of the field project, the tutor will guide the students to refine the final research results, and also guide the students to design and execute public welfare projects in combination with their own strengths.</p>
            <p class="item-title">Does participating in the project help our application for further education?
            </p>
            <p class="item-intro">Students can learn professional public interest knowledge, master research skills, complete high-quality project results, receive project certificates and receive letters of recommendation. Many of the students have followed up with one or two years of charity work. These experiences helped them apply to Princeton University, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, Cambridge University and other prestigious universities.</p>
            <p class="item-title">Some students might have classes in the evening. Can they participate in the project?</p>
            <p class="item-intro">In the online course before the field survey, the tutor will count the time of each student and coordinate the arrangement so that all students can participate in the online course as much as possible. If the student is unable to attend the course due to temporary affairs, the tutor will also record the course and send it to the student separately to help the student keep up with the learning progress.</p>
            <p class="item-title">If we are unable to travel due to the epidemic, will you refund the fare?</p>
            <p class="item-intro">The safety and health of our students are our primary objective. On the one hand, we are paying close attention to the situation of the epidemic across the country and keeping in touch with local public welfare organizations to ensure that we are informed of the situation of the epidemic in the project areas and take action as soon as possible. On the other hand, we have also prepared masks, temperature guns, hand sanitizers and other epidemic prevention materials and basic medicines for the students to ensure their health during the field stay. If there is an outbreak before departure, we will immediately communicate with the parents and provide alternative plans, refunds, or extensions as the case may be.</p>
